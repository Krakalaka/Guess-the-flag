# Guess the flag
This is a site where you guess from what country the flag is from.

## How you can use this Website
You can access this site by searching [krakalaka.github.io/Guess-the-flag/](https://krakalaka.github.io/Guess-the-flag/).
When the page open, a flag will appear on the page and you will have four options. After you guess what country the flag is from, you can press the 'next' button to continue playing. The game is endless. The flags and options can repeat a few times

## About the project
This is the first time that I used an API in a website and also the first time I tried making a light and dark theme for a webpage. You can check the API [here](https://restcountries.com/).
